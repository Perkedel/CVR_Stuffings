UPDATE 1.0.0 (04.12.2023) Changes:
- Release!

UPDATE 1.0.1 (04.12.2023) Changes:
- Missing MeshFilter mesh bug fixed. Now always auto-creates new flexicurve meshes!

UPDATE 1.0.2 (05.12.2023) Changes:
- Duplication works correctly now. It now creates a new geometry file instead of referencing the old one after duplication.

UPDATE 1.0.3 (08.12.2023) Changes:
- Previous fix caused another bug, when a new mesh file was created every time you select a FlexiCurve object. Fixed now!
