I mean, all Perkedel employees in any division basically requires 18+ years old, which is the minimum appropriate age of accepting paid jobs & contracts. If there is something that requires special condition for the target job, we can use the technology to pitch up for the work, OR using their natural abilities. You know, mix it up together? It's common industry practice!

### Assorted

These are the GUID from our cache folder of CVR.

- ..

## Additional Info

### GUID

Ensure to detach the GUID if you'd like to make new variant of these prefabs.

For employee: **DO NOT LOSE THE GUID!! MAKE SURE IT IS STILL ATTACHED, & IS SAME MATCH WITH THE PAGE IT UPLOADED TO!**

### Are these done by Realizer division?

Not officially. Although some Realizer members had involved, still it was done by serveral other volunteers at Perkedel Technologies who worked with this in their free time.

Due to different settings and goal with the game engine CVR used, There is no dedicated division handling content creation for this social media. So, Ricitello, **PECK YOU!!**

### Weren't you supposed to make your own Godot social media?

Creating social media on its own is huge responsibilities. It is not a simple hassle and burdens to take. While the server (for usual opinions) will be as neutral as possible & dev themselves may not, these days, neutrality is a necessity. Or let's say, **siding a necessity**, in which **it is required to ban people on certain usual opinion sets** in favour of bigger more evil threats that must be obeyed, in order to legally operate, among other things.

Although, VR Sandbox can still be possible, **BUT** without the social media capability. It won't be GodotChat. **Meja** (Open Source Tabletop simulator clone). More like industrial physics simulation framework.

This **Kantor 369 Meja** is one that will officially be built by Realizers. Later.

### Unity?! Don't they will steal your soul?

Fortunately, in desperation, Unity had partially rolled back their new paywallism-partialism agendas. Therefore, only by the new version after 2024, will they succ our soul like Shang Tsung.

Therefore, the version of Unity (`Unity 2021.3.23f1`) used by AlphaBlend Interactive & for these creations of it are **not subject to Neo-Paywall-Partialism / Runtime Fee agenda**. Everyone in this version should be safe, for now. Because if not wrong, these legacy versions shall be supported until spans of 2024. However, we have yet confirmed would Unity impose punishment us gamers who stuck in these legacy version prior to this agenda.

Be knowledgeful also, that ABI already built their software & set goals for long since before. Therefore, to stop and *port* to other engines is not a viable option. This can only be done from scratch with different set of instructions. We shall see further, so stay tuned.
